**** Abstract ****
  This program takes as input an Ada program, and outputs the program
  colorized, indented and with capitalization according to commandline 
  options.

  note: any RTF capable word processor or text editor on any platform 
  that supports color will display colorized code.

  To see usage, simply run reformat with no command line options. 

  FORMAT is based on the reformatter from AdaGIDE, the Ada GNAT
  Integrated Development Environment for Win 95/NT.  For more 
  information on AdaGIDE, see:
 
  http://www.usafa.af.mil/dfcs/bios/mcc_html/adagide.html


FORMAT is free software-- see below for more information.

**** Reporting Bugs ****

If you have found a possible bug in FORMAT,
please let me know.  I'll make every effort to fix it as 
soon as possible.  It is best if you provide a sequence 
of steps that will enable me to recreate the error
(and the file(s) that caused the problem).

**** Building FORMAT ****

Using pkunzip, simply unzip them in a directory and type (if using GNAT):

gnatmake reformat 

Otherwise, follow the directions for your compiler.
